# Network Traffic Analysis & Protocol Auditing
**Status:** In Progress

## Executive Summary
This repository documents my network traffic analysis work. I capture traffic, identify key protocols/behaviors, and record proof (screenshots/logs) plus troubleshooting steps.

## What’s Inside
- `/proof` → screenshots, capture evidence, and validation artifacts
- `/diagnostics` → errors I hit + how I fixed them
- `/configs` → any config changes (if used)
- `/scripts` → any automation/scripts (if used)

## Verification Evidence
See the `/proof` folder for artifacts that show the work was executed successfully.
